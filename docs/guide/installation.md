# Installation

Orango can be installed using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). So we suggest you already have installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and NPM in your system.

Run this in the terminal in your project folder:

### NPM

``` bash
$ npm i orango --save
```

### Yarn

``` bash
$ yarn add orango
```
