**Orango** is an Object Data Modeler (ODM) that provides the following features: (**Draft**)

* Central connectivity to ArangoDB
* Automated creation of databases, collections and indexing
* Ability to pre-populate database with data
* and more...

### Why use an ODM? (*Draft*)

* Ease of use
* Focus on data instead of queries
* Optimized queries
* Validation prevent bad data from being injected into database
* Cleaner interfaces
* Single point of change for bug fixes, features, etc
* Computed properties on return values
* Default values for missing values

### Documentation

Official documentation can be found at **[orango.js.org](https://orango.js.org)**. (*Work in progress and yes, I know, there is very little*)

### Project Status
**I started Orango at the beginning of August 2018**. This project is in `pre-release` and the API is subject to change as functionality and workflow is being developed. Once the dust settles, I will move it into an `alpha`.

**[19 Oct 2018]** 0.9.4 released. Bug fixes. Updates to examples (still in progress). To get the example up and running, refer to the examples `README.md`. The server's controllers and models directories and `app.js` are where Orango is defined and used.

**[08 Oct 2018]** 0.9.3 released. Added authentication for connecting to database. Ability to create new databases with authenticated user. I worked on Edge collections and models and now provide a more streamlined approach with link() and unlink(). Many updates to the examples/server. Working on creating a mock twitter application. Other bug fixes.

**[03 Oct 2018]** 0.9.0 released. A second iteration of `populate()` is available. In addition, `var()`, `append()` and `merge()` were added. The documentation and examples are really lacking at this point. I am still working on examples and then documentation will follow after the API feels a little less ephemeral. I would not recommend using Orango yet for any real development until I have completed the examples to test the workflow. I am still finding some parts that are missing / or needing refactoring as I am trying to use it.

**[26 Sep 2018]** I am working on fixing the current issues and and continuing on example project. There is quite a bit of refactoring in the latest commits and API changes as the workflow is being evaluated.

**[19 Sept 2018]**  On vacation, thx for the feedback. I will be at it again once I am back.

**[10 Sept 2018]**  I am currently working on an example project. The [example](https://github.com/roboncode/orango/tree/examples) branch will provide an initial use case in a "real-world" application using Express. It also allows me to find missing workflows that are needed for an initial release. One of those features coming down the pipeline is `populate()` - which provides the ability to populate properties from other collections when fetching data.

**[04 Sept 2018]**  I have tests in place currently at [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/roboncode/orango/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/roboncode/orango?branch=master)  . I am testing out the API workflow on a test project and then I will working on the documentation. In the meantime, if you are eager to start using Orango, I would recommend looking at the test cases for examples. There are other items on the Roadmap but I am working on a stable 1.0 release

### Installation

First be sure you have ArangoDB and Node.js installed. You can easily install ArangoDB using the [official docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/arangodb/arangodb/). There is also a `docker-compose.yml` file that is in the `tools` directory if you want to copy it to your project, then all you have to do is run the code below to start an instance of ArangoDB.

```cmd
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Next, install Orango from the command line using `npm`:

```cmd
$ npm install orango
```

### Importing

```js
// Using Node.js `require()`
const orango = require('orango')

// Using ES6 imports
import orango from 'orango'
```

## Overview

### Connecting to ArangoDB

First, we need to define a connection. If your app uses only one database, you should use `orango.connect()`. If you need to create additional connections, use `orango.get( instanceName:String ).connect()`.

The method `connect(db:String="_system", [{url:String="http://localhost:8529", username:String, password:String}])` takes database name with options to establish a connection. Otherwise, it will use the default values.

```js
const orango = require('orango')

orango.events.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Orango is connected!')
})

async function main() {
   await orango.connect()
}

main()
```

> Orango buffers model definitions, so they can be defined before or after a connection is established.

### Defining a Model

```js
const BlogPost = orango.Schema({
	author: String,
	title: String,
	body: String,
	date: Date	
})

orango.model('blog', BlogPost)
```
Aside from defining the structure of your documents and data types, a Schema handles the definition of:

* Validators
* Default values
* Indexes
* Middleware
* Methods definitions
* Statics definitions
* Computed properties
* Pre and post events
* Real-joins (thanks ArangoDB!)
* Custom queries
* Filtering unknown properties
* Support for Joi syntax

The following example shows some of these features:

```js
const orango = require('orango')
const Joi = require('joi')

const User = orango.Schema({
	firstName: String,
	lastName: String,
	email: Joi.string().email(), // Joi can be used directly
	age: { type: Number, min: 18 }, // JSON gets converted to Joi data types automatically
	bio: { type: String, regex: /[a-z]/ },
	updated: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}, {
	strict: true, // properties not defined will be filtered out
	indexes: [ // create indexes for items we will query against
      {
        type: 'hash',
        fields: ['email']
      },
      {
        type: 'skipList',
        fields: ['firstName']
      },
      {
        type: 'skipList',
        fields: ['lastName']
      }
    ]
})

User.statics.findByEmail = async function(email) {
	return this.findOne({ email })
}

// computed property
User.computed.name = function() {
	return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
}

orango.model('user', User)

// ... in code somewhere else ... //

let user = async User
	.findByEmail('roboncode+orango@gmail.com')
	.computed(true)
	
console.log('Hello,', user.name)
```

### Accessing a Model

Once we define a model through `orango.model('ModelName', mySchema)`, we can access it through the same function

```js
const MyModel = orango.model('ModelName')
```

Or just do it all at once

```js
const MyModel = orango.model('ModelName', mySchema)
```
The first argument is the singular name of the collection your model is for. **Orango automatically looks for the plural version of your model name.** For example, if you use

```js
const MyModel = orango.model('Ticket', mySchema);
```

Then Orango will create the model for your **tickets** collection, not your **ticket** collection.

Once we have our model, we can then instantiate it, and save it:

```js
const instance = new MyModel();
instance.my.key = 'hello';
instance.save()
```

Or we can find documents from the same collection

```js
let docs = await MyModel.find()
```
You can also `findOne`, `findById`, `findByQuery`, `updateOne`, etc. For more details check out [the docs](#).

**Important!** If you opened a separate connection using `orango.get('anotherNameBesidesDefault')` but attempt to access the model through `orango.model('ModelName')` it will not work as expected since it is not hooked up to the active db connection. In this case access your model through the connection you created:

```js
const example = orango.get('example')
example.connect()
const MyModel = example.model('ModelName', schema)
const m = new MyModel()
m.save() // works
```

--vs--

```js
const example = orango.get('example')
example.connect()
example.model('ModelName', schema)

// will not be found because it it was not registered with this instance
const MyModel = orango.model('ModelName')
const m = new MyModel()
m.save()
```

#### Tang Data Modeler

The data modeler allows you to register models.

Tang is a data modeler. It allows you to build schemas and models in a simplified JSON structure and apply those schemas against your data. It is I/O agnostic. It is a high-scaled version of the Joi API.

Tang also has a builder which can call built-in and custom functions to manipulate data in an asynchronous and optimized manner.

**Example of defining a model**

```js
let schema = new Schema(...)
module.exports = orango.model('User', schema)
```

### Model has many built-in query methods

* setConnection
* find
* findByEdge
* findById
* findByIdAndDelete
* findByIdAndUpdate
* findByQuery
* findMany
* updateOne
* deleteOne
* deleteMany
* findOne
* deleteMany
* findOne
* getCollection
* importMany
* updateMany
* remove
* save
	
### Supports additional cool features like:

* Conditional "$or" statements in query
* Automatic removal of default values
* Strict schemas which automatically strips unknown properties
* Simple incrementation of values using "++/--" or "$inc"
* Simple sorting using using strings
* Simple return value filtering
* Print as AQL
* Performance measurements on data conversion
* and more...



### ORM for common query functions for document retrieval and modification

* toAQL: returns the AQL string version of query
* action(find | findEdge | update | delete)
* collection
* computed
* connection
* criteria
* data
* exec
* limit
* model
* offset
* options
* query
* schemaOptions
* select
* sort
